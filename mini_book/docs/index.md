# Programming for Quantitative Economics



These notes present a set of lectures on Python programming for quantitative
economics, designed and written by [Thomas J.  Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/)
and [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/).

They were built using the new-look Sphinx-based
[Jupyter Book](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) 2.0 tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  

They are intended mainly as a demonstration these tools.

These lectures are a mini-version of a [longer example] (XXX ADD LINK XXX),
which is also built using Jupyter Book.  That series contains more features
and applications but also requires more libraries and takes longer to run.  

Both lecture series taken from a [larger set of lectures](https://python.quantecon.org) 
on open source computing hosted by [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org).
